    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>Not much to see here, yet.</p>
    <p>This page and webspace will hopefully serve as a showcase for projects and whatever I learn I JS & CSS.</p>
    <p>Since I found out I could host webpages here on GitHub, this last weekend, not much has happened, of course. But I'll give my best to link existing content, create new ones & aspecially style this all - or even make it fully responsible. I've got still a lot to learn... :(</p>
    <p>I'm also trying to implement a page  that will use the <a href="https://zelda-api.apius.cc">ZELDA API</a> from <a href="https://github.com/deliton">Deliton Junior</a> to do minimalistic searches and have some interactive element here. But that, again, is still a long way to go. Especially CSS ist fascinating but also really hard to figure out. It's like enormous amounts of bells & whistles that kinda get me distracted, as I'd like to learn about all of them at once!</p>

    <p>If you have any suggestions, let me know. A few contact options are linked in my <a href="https://github.com/n-c0de-r">GitHub Profile</a>, other than that (since this is hosted as a repo in GitHub) you can suggest improvements or ideas as <a href="https://github.com/n-c0de-r/n-c0de-r.github.io/issues">issues</a> anytime. I appreciate any feedback that makes me grow and get better.</p>
